# Getting Started with Create React App
An 5 day forecast weather app can fetch weather of any location from any location for next 5 days, made using react. It can find weather of any location(Need not to know name of the location can fetch using GPS) and its info like cloudy and etc for the next 5 days. The app is made in such a way that it has a property of dynamic background(around 107 images) so that it adjusts it background image with respect to the climatic condition of the fetched location. It showws many properties of the climate like windspeed, pressure, sunrise and sunset time anad lot more... The five day forecast also shows many attributes of weather on that with an icon indicating weather on that day.
